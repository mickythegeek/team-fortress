# Team Fortress
AI-Powered Institutional Intelligence for Payment Systems

Sector: Emerging Technology (AI) + Payments
Hackathon: Interswitch × Enyata Buildathon 2026

# Overview

We are building a system that integrates Interswitch APIs to provide real-time payment insights, and transaction reasoning for businesses.

Modern enterprises generate massive volumes of transaction data but dashboards don’t explain why things happen.

Our system goes beyond analytics. It interprets, explains, and preserves financial operational knowledge using advanced LLM-driven reasoning.

# The Problem
Businesses using payment infrastructure often struggle with:

-Unexplained transaction failures

-Limited visibility into anomaly patterns

-Raw dashboards without contextual reasoning

-Loss of institutional knowledge across teams

-Payment data exists, but intelligence does not.

# Our Proposed Solution
To build an AI reasoning layer on top of Interswitch’s payment infrastructure.

The system:

-Analyzes transaction data from Interswitch APIs

-Uses LLM-powered reasoning to explain failures

-Detects anomalies and unusual payment patterns

-Preserves operational knowledge for teams

-Provides a conversational interface for financial insights

Instead of asking:

“What happened?”

You can ask:

“Why did settlement volume drop 18% yesterday?”
“Explain the spike in declined transactions.”
“Summarize today’s transaction anomalies.”

And get structured, explainable answers.

Deployment

Vercel / GCP / Render

# Key Features
1️⃣ Payment Failure Intelligence

Explains why transactions failed using structured API response reasoning.

2️⃣ AI Financial Insights Assistant

Converts raw transaction logs into human-readable summaries.

3️⃣ Institutional Memory

Stores resolved cases and explanations to reduce repeated investigation time.

# Why This Matters for Africa

African enterprises rely heavily on digital payments infrastructure.

When transactions fail or anomalies occur, delays can cost millions.

Our system adds an intelligence layer to African fintech infrastructure to enable:

- Faster resolution times

- Better operational awareness

- Reduced financial risk

- Stronger institutional continuity
