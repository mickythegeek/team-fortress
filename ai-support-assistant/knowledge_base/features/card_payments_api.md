# Card Payments API

Card payment APIs allow businesses to accept card payments online and in mobile apps. They provide a secure and efficient way to process payments and can be integrated with various payment methods.
It also allows you to manage the payment flow from end to end. This means that you can build your own user interfaces and customer experiences.
You must have a PCI DSS compliance certificate to use the Card Payments API.

Depending on the configuration tied to the card and your business profile, the purchase request may result in two scenarios:
a. Immediate Authorization:
If the card is configured for immediate authorization, you will receive a response indicating whether the transaction was successful or failed. You can then proceed to check the transaction status.
b. Authentication Required:
If authentication is needed, you will receive a response code indicating whether an OTP has been sent to the customer's phone (T0) or 3D Secure authentication is required (S0).
If the response code is T0, the customer must provide the OTP to complete the transaction. You can then call the Interswitch Authenticate OTP API to authenticate the OTP by making 
POST
 request to the following endpoint:
Text

In the request body, include the following parameters:
paymentId:
